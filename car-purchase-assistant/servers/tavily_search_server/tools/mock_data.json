    "url": "https://www.leaseloco.com/car-leasing-vs-buying-guide-2024",
    "content": "Choosing between leasing and buying a car depends on your financial situation, driving habits, and preferences. Leasing offers lower monthly payments, the ability to drive newer cars more frequently, and no depreciation concerns, but you don't build equity and face mileage restrictions. Buying provides eventual ownership, no mileage limits, and the ability to customize your vehicle, but requires higher monthly payments and you bear the depreciation risk. Leasing is ideal for those who want the latest technology and don't drive excessive miles, while buying suits those who drive many miles or want to keep their car long-term. Consider your annual mileage, budget, and how often you want to change vehicles when making this decision."
